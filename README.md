Originally planned to only be repo for some code for BIP39. Now also have BIP32 partially implemented , ability to connect to network nodes and construct a tx. **Not far away from a SPV client!** Bitcoin script next? Goal is to visit different part of the Bitcoin stack, not write a complete Bitcoin library.

Look at [btcsuite](https://github.com/btcsuite) if you are looking for production software. This repo is mostly for me to learn, not to write production software. Can't experiment with elliptic curves if I write production software ;) (don't roll your own crypto)
